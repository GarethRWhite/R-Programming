# Data Types - Missing Values

## Missing Values
Denoted by NA or NaN
is.na() is used for mathematical operations
is.nan() is used for everything else.

NA values have a class.
There are Integer NA (missing Integer values), character NA (missing character values), etc.

NaN value is also NA
But NA is not necessarily a NaN

## Missing Values

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 10, 3)
is.na(x)
is.nan(x)
x <- c(1, 2, NaN, NA, 4)
is.nan(x)
```
