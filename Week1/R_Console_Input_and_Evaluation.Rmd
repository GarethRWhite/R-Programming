```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Entering Input

```{r}
x <- 1
print(x)
```

<- is the assignement operator
x is a symbol, a numeric object with 1 element, a Vector.
print is a function.

# Evaluation


```{r}
x <- 5 ## nothing printed
```

```{r}
x ## auto-printing occurs
```
The [1] indicates that x is a vector and 5 is the first element.

```{r}
print(x) ## explicit printing
```


# Printing

```{r}
x <- 1:20
x
```
Colon operator creates a sequence.
