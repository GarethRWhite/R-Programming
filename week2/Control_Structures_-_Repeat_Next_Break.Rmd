# Control Structures - Repeat, Next, Break

## Repeat
Infinite loop.
Only way to exit is break.

x <- 1
tol <- 1e-8

repeat
{
  x1 <- computeEstimate()
  
  if(abs(x1 - x0) < tol)
  {
    break
  }
  else
  {
    x0 <- x1
  }
}

Could run forever.
Better to set fixed limit (e.g., with for loop), then report whether convergence was achieved or not.


## Next, return
Next skips an iteration of a loop.

```{r}
for(i in 1:100) {
  if(i <= 20)
  {
    ## Skip the first 20 iterations
    next
  }
  ## Do something here
}
```

return signals that a function should exit and return a value.

## Control Structures
Use the *apply functions for interactive work instead.
