# Data Types - Data Frames
Store tabular data
A list, where every elemnet has the same length.
Each element can be thought of as a column.
The length of each element can be thought of as the number of rows.
Like lists, data frames can store objects of different class in each column. Whereas matrices can only store objects of the same class.
Has attribute row.names()
Usually created with:
read.table()
read.csv()
Convert to matrix with: data.matrix(), though coercion will apply.

# Data frames
```{r}
x <- data.frame(foo=1:4, bar=c(T, T, T, F)) # Created columnwise, so foo is first column, bar is second column
x
nrow(x)
ncol(x)
```
