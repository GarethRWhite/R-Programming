# Subsetting - Remoing Missing Values
https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/Qy8bH/subsetting-removing-missing-values

## Removing NA Values

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 5)
bad < is.na(x) # Logical vector, which is TRUE if the element is missing.
x[!bad]
```

## Removing NA Values

Multiple things, and you want the subset with no missing values.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)
y <- c("a", "b", NA, "d", NA, "f")
good <- complete.cases(x,y) # Which are all non-missing?
good
x[good]
y[good]
```

```{r}
airquality[1:6, ]
good <- complete.cases(airquality)
airquality[good, ][1:6, ]
```
