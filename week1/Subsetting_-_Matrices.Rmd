# Subsetting - Matrics
https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/4gSc1/subsetting-matrices

## Subsetting a Matrix

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x[1,2]
x[2,1]
```

Indices can be left missing

```{r}
x[1,] # First row
x[,2] # Second column
```

## Subsetting a Matrix
By default, when a single element of a matrix is returned, it is a vector of length 1 (not the same type as the original, which would be a 1x1 matrix).
By default, drop = TRUE, which "drops" the dimension (i.e., instead of a 2D object, you get a 1D object).
To return a 1x1 matrix, set drop = FALSE

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x[1,2]
x[1,2, drop=FALSE]
```

## Subsetting a Matrix
Subsetting a single row or column will give a vector, not a matrix by default.

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x[1,]
x[1, drop=FALSE]
```
