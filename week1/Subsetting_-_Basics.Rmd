# Subsetting - Basics
https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/JDoLX/subsetting-basics

## Subsetting
[]
Always retuns an object of the same class as the original.
Can be used to return more than one element

[[]]
Extract elements from a list or data frame.
Can only select a *single element*.
Class is not necessarily the same as the original.

$
Extract elements by name from list or data frame.
Similar semantics to [[]]

## Subsetting

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "a")
x[1]
x[2]
x[1:4]
x[x > "a"]
u <- x > "a"
u
x[u]
```
